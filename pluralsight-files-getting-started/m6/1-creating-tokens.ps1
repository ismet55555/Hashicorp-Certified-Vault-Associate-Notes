# First of all we are going to start Vault in development mode
vault server -dev

# Now set your Vault address environment variable
$env:VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"

# Set the root token variable
$root_token="ROOT_TOKEN_VALUE"

# And log into Vault using the root token
vault login $root_token

# First we are going to create a basic token

vault token create -policy=default -ttl=60m

# Now let's check out some info on the token

vault token lookup TOKEN_VALUE

# We can do the same using the accessor, but no ID

vault token lookup -accessor ACCESSOR_VALUE

# Now let's revoke our token

vault token revoke -accessor ACCESSOR_VALUE

# Cool, now let's enable an auth method and explore TTL a bit
