# Next let's log in with our AppRole method
# We're going to need to log back in with our root token first
vault login 

 # Alright now what do we need to log in with AppRole?

 # Okay, so we need the role_id and secret_id
 # Let's get the role_id first

vault read auth/GloboAppRole/role/webapp/role-id

# Now let's get the secret_id, since we're generating data we
# need to use the write command instead

# And now we can log in! This also uses the write command
vault write auth/GloboAppRole/login role_id=$roleId secret_id=$secretId

# Sweet, now we could use that token in future requests

# Lastly, let's try logging in using the API with AppRole instead
