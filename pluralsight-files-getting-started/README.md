Exercise files for my course Hashicorp Certified Vault Associate: Getting Started

## Welcome!

Welcome to the exercise files for my Pluralsight course Hashicorp Certified Vault Associate: Getting Started. The intention of this course is to prepare you to take the the exam for the Vault Associate certification. This is the first of two courses to prepare you. I'll link the second course when it is done.

## Pre-requisites

The good news is that you don't need much to follow along on the course. We are not going to use any services that are not built into the Vault binary. There's no AWS, MySQL, Active Directory, or anything like that. And, the first thing we're going to do is download the Vault binary. You don't even need that to start with!

I would recommend being familiar with the command line in general. The examples are given in both PowerShell and Bash, so you can follow along on a Windows, Linux, or Mac system. Yes, I know Mac uses `zsh`, but like grenades and thermo-nuclear warfare, it's close enough. Aside from that, you just need to be able to run the Vault executable and have two console windows open. That's it!
