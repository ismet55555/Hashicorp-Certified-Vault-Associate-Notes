# Hashicorp-Certified-Vault-Associate-Getting-Started

Exercise files for my course Hashicorp Certified Vault Associate: Vault Management

## Welcome!

Welcome to the exercise files for my Pluralsight course Hashicorp Certified Vault Associate: Vault Management. The intention of this course is to prepare you to take the the exam for the Vault Associate certification. This is the second of two courses to prepare you. You can find the first course here. I'd highly recommend taking that course first.

## Pre-requisites

The good news is that you don't need much to follow along on the course. We are not going to use any services that are not built into the Vault binary. There's no AWS, MySQL, Active Directory, or anything like that. And, the first thing we're going to do is download the Vault binary. You don't even need that to start with! You will need Docker Desktop or its equivalent available. We are going to spin up Vault server in a container and feed it a config file.

I would recommend being familiar with the command line in general. The examples are given in both PowerShell and Bash, so you can follow along on a Windows, Linux, or Mac system. Yes, I know Mac uses `zsh`, but like grenades and thermo-nuclear warfare, it's close enough. Aside from that, you just need to be able to run the Vault executable, Docker Desktop, and have two console windows open. That's it!
